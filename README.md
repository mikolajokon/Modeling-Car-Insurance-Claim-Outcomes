# Modeling-Car-Insurance-Claim-Outcomes
Clean customer data and use logistic regression to predict whether people will make a claim on their car insurance!

<b>Pandas | Numpy | Statsmodels | </b>

Identify the single feature of the data that is the best predictor of whether a customer will put in a claim (the "outcome" column), excluding the "id" column.
Store as a DataFrame called best_feature_df, containing columns named "best_feature" and "best_accuracy" with the name of the feature with the highest accuracy, and the respective accuracy score.
